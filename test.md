My name is Alan Luo. I live in Baltimore City, Maryland. I studied analytics in grad school and now build data solutions for a living. Data is my life blood. I enjoy crunching numbers and writing code.

This site contains a list of projects I've worked on in the past and will highlight not just content related to data analytics but also data engineering. Youâ€™re most welcome to [contact me](mailto:alan@outlook.com) for potential employment, to make comments, or to give advice. Feel free to visit [my github](https://github.com/datamanju) as well.
