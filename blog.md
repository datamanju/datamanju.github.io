### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you  track progression and raise your awareness of your surroundings. Recently, I been trying to make small improvements in my life. Starting a blog is one of them.
