### Sleep and Lucid Dreams

`Jun 8th, Sunday 2021`

I was sitting with my grandpa at my parent's home in the south. It was a little cloudy, but the cool sea breeze that came along with it was welcoming. We were on the veranda of our home on the fifth floor of the building. Grandpa sat on a on a little stool with his back against the wall, and we admired the towering residential buildings around us. I fumbled through my guitar a little bit, played a couple riffs and then asked grandpa what he liked about the south. He chuckled and said that he'd prefer here since he'd get usually sunburnt if he were hanging out in his home city. I laughed and the dream ended. I woke up but decided to lay in bed for a while, savoring the details of the dream. Grandpa was someone that I dearly missed. 

Quote "Dreams feel real while we are in them, it's only when we wake up that we realize something was strange." A lucid dream is a type of dream where the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment. Wouldn't it be cool if there were a device that controls lucid dreams. It'd definitely serve as a good therapeutic tool, with the ability to satisfy desires and bring memories of people back.


### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you  raise your awareness of your surroundings. Recently, I been trying to make small improvements to my life. Starting a blog is one of them. 

I'm a beginner when it comes to building sites. It took hours upon hours to get this site up and running. Today, I wanted to add a comments section to my articles, but I realized that addons risked sharing user information to a third party. I looked into the github workaround, but it was tedious to manage. I decided to wait and see if Github would be adding any new features for this in the future.

Circling back to self improvement, I found a podcast from a renowned scholar on how to improve yourself, some good tips include:
- Schedule your day, aim to place yourself in a better position than you were at the beginning of the day;
- Regularly exercise to increase your energy and prevent mental decay;
- Practice orderliness, clean up your room;
- Every time you have an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill, do it;
- Surround yourself with competent people and develop your network.
