### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you  raise your awareness of your surroundings. Recently, I been trying to make small improvements to my life. Starting a blog is one of them. 

I'm a beginner when it comes to building sites. It took hours upon hours to get this site up and running. Today, I wanted to add a comments section to my articles, but I realized that addons risked sharing user information to a third party. I looked into the github workaround, but it was tedious to manage. I decided to wait and see if Github would be adding any new features for this in the future.
