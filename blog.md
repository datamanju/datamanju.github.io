### Sleep and Lucid Dreams

`Jun 8th, Tuesday 2021`

I was sitting with my grandpa at my parent's home in the south. It was a little cloudy, but the cool sea breeze made it all the more welcoming. We were on the veranda of our home on the fifth floor of the building. Grandpa looked a bit younger in his early 50s. He sat on a little stool with his back against the wall. We talked about life aspirations while admiring the towering buildings around us. At one point I asked grandpa what he liked about the south. He chuckled and said that he'd prefer here since he'd get usually sunburnt if in his home town. We laughed and continued on with our conversation. After a couple more minutes the dream ended. I woke up quite awake, but decided to lay in bed for a while to savoring the details of the dream. Grandpa had passed away 8 years ago and I miss him dearly.

### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you  raise your awareness of your surroundings. Recently, I been trying to make small improvements to my life. Starting a blog is one of them. 

Some other tips I found from a podcast on how to improve yourself:
- Schedule your day, aim to place yourself in a better position than you were at the beginning of the day;
- Regularly exercise to increase your energy and prevent mental decay;
- Practice orderliness, clean up your room;
- Every time you have an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill, do it;
- Surround yourself with competent people and develop your network.
