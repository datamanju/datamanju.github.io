### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you keep track of your progression in life. It can be used to express your gratitude and joys of life. Recently, I been trying to improve certain perspectives of my life. Thus, it seemed like a good idea to start a blog.
