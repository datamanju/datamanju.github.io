### Craving Lasagna

`Jun 13th, Sunday 2021`

I was looking for ingredients for Lasagna today but after strolling through the grocery aisles at our local supermarket like a mad man, I soon realized I couldn't find the right ingredients for the dish. 

What I did find was an offer of store-made Lasagna. After asking the clerk pn how to cook it, he elaborated that I simply had to bake it at 350F for about 30 minutes and it'd be hot and ready. When I got home, I followed the clerk's instructions and put the Lasagna in the oven. The dish turned out to be a bit greasy on the top but I other than that, it was fine. I scooped it out onto a plate and started examining it from all angles. 

Finally, I grabbed a fork and dug into it. I was disappointed. On one hand, we have this beautifully layered construct of cheese, pasta, and meat sauce on a plate. On the other hand, the taste resembles any other tomato meat sauce-based pasta dish, making it quite ordinary.

I decided to do a google search and find out what if all lasagna's were like this. I came across a video titled "$13 Lasagna vs $60 Lasagna". The difference between the store-bought and restaurant-made Lasagna was quite obvious. The restaurant Lasagna was less saucy, more burnt, and was made out of better pasta and cheese. After finishing the video I put it on my bucket list to visit one of these restaurants one day.

### Sleep and Lucid Dreams

`Jun 8th, Tuesday 2021`

I was sitting with my grandpa at my parent's home in the south. It was a little cloudy, but the cool sea breeze made it all the more welcoming. We were on the veranda of our home on the fifth floor of the building. Grandpa looked a bit younger in his early 50s. He sat on a little stool with his back against the wall. We talked about life aspirations while admiring the towering buildings around us. At one point I asked grandpa what he liked about the south. He chuckled and said that he'd prefer here since he'd get usually sunburnt if in his hometown. We laughed and continued with our conversation. After a couple more minutes the dream ended. I woke up quite awake but decided to lay in bed for a while to savor the details of the dream. Grandpa had passed away 8 years ago and I miss him dearly.

### The Beginning of a Blog

`Jun 6th, Sunday 2021`

I'm not particularly fond of online blogging. Anything you post comes with risks. Your opinions today may be used against you tomorrow. On the bright side, blogging can help you raise your awareness of your surroundings. Recently, I have been trying to make small improvements to my life. Starting a blog is one of them. 

Some other tips I found from a podcast on how to improve yourself:
- Schedule your day, aim to place yourself in a better position than you were at the beginning of the day;
- Regularly exercise to increase your energy and prevent mental decay;
- Practice orderliness, clean up your room;
- Every time you have an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill, do it;
- Surround yourself with competent people and develop your network.
