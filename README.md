## Self Intro

My name is Alan and I am a Data Enthusiast. I enjoy analyzing and visualizing datasets with tools such as python and powerBI. This is a blog that documents some of my life and some of the lessons I learned while doing data analysis. If you'd like to learn more about my projects, feel free to visit [my github](https://github.com/datamanju).
