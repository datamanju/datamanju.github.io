title: Why Data Analytics is hard?
---

I've been working in two different industries over the past 5 years as a data analyst. I have a masters, and continue to do online training. I even enrolled in bootcamp to reinforce what I had learned. But at the end of the day, I still feel that being a data analyst is hard. The challenges mainly come from three sides:

1. Issues aren't limited to Data or Analytics alone.

2. You are limited by your tools.

3. Not all users are tech savvy and sympethic.  

4. You are expected to have great management skills.

5. You start to question your sanity, your IQ, your education? Are you an imposter?
