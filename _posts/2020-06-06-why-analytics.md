title: Why Data Analytics Isn't Just About Analytics?
---

I've been working as a data analyst in two different industries over the past 5 years. Data Analytics as a skill in itself isn't difficult to learn. The main challenge that comes with being a data analyst revolves around understanding, obtaining, and cleaning data. When a system or application is created, the database structure is designed by the developer. A data analyst's job is to figure out how and why a developer designed a data structure in a specific way, and figure out how they can extract that data to build dashboards and insights around them. On paper, this might seem easy: extract the data, write the SQL or Python code, build a couple of bar charts. But not so fast, here are a couple of issues that the analyst will counter:

  1. Where will the data be stored? In a database, in a datalake, in a data warehouse, which format is most suitable? Are there storage limitations?
  2. What is the Data Extraction Process like? Is it efficient enough to extract data without affecting the efficiency of the system database?
  3. Is the data accurately being extracted? Are there specific data that are being left out?
  4. What happens when a record is deleted in the original system, can the destination storage account for deletions? 
  5. What are the metrics to be used in the dashboard? What does management expect to see when they open it up?
  6. Is there a demand for raw data? If so, how can that info be seamlessly provided to management?

You see, the issues a data analyst faces are also tied to computer systems. In a sense, you and your team are designing a new system to bring analytical insight to your viewers. As with any system, the design needs to be reliable and valuable. Users should be able to repetitively run the system without encountering difficulty or errors while obtaining valuable information that is presented in a readable comprehensive format. Usually, when a solution is flawed, you'd hear users complain "The data is not right, something is amiss?" or "These metrics are not meaningful, I need something I can use." In this situation, it's best that the data analyst goes back to the drawing board and figure out what is needed to be done to create a better system.

To quote a Principal Engineer from Amazon: "Your ideas can't be half-baked. You make an impassioned plea to architect your system, and your team does it, they are going to expect a payoff. If things get worse, you are in deep doo-doo. So it will take time and energy, on top of your existing duties to do deep designs and analysis." 

On top of what I mentioned, as a data analyst, you might also encounter tools with missing features, broken software, no documentation, badly designed data structures, no data in your test environment, unclear design direction, etc. Being mentally prepped and having plans for dealing with all these unfavorable situations will allow a data analyst to become more successful in projects.

Now, moving the technical points aside, we also need to cover domain knowledge. To a data analyst, domain knowledge is extremely important. Each industry has their measurements of success: for E-commerce, that's conversion rates, buying frequency and basket size; for Associations, it's membership enrollment and course signups; for Sports, it's player performance and ticket sales; for Online Games, it's player engagement and average player value. Once you've figured out what measurements are useful, the next step is to see how to present that data in a digestable format for all stakeholders. Sure, executives probably look at spreadsheets all day, but after an exhausting day of work, would they want to open up a performance report with another spreadsheet of summary data in it. The answer is: No. So it is up to the analysts to weave something that would peak the interest of the executive. A canvas that tells them exactly how the company or organization is doing.
