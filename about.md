My name is Alan Luo. I'm from Redfield, Arkansas. I studied analytics in grad school and now build dashboards for a living. Data is my life blood. Yes, I enjoy crunching numbers and writing code.

This site records my progression towards the goal of becoming a data scientist. Occasionally I'll include content about other aspects of my life. Youâ€™re most welcome to [contact me](mailto:alan_l@datamanju.com) for potential employment, to make comments, or to give suggestions.
